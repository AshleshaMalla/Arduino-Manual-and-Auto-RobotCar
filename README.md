# Arduino-Manual-and-Auto-RobotCar
This project showcases the creation of a versatile Robot Car using an Arduino platform. The car is equipped with both manual and auto modes, providing users with the flexibility to either control the car manually using a bluetooth-controlled remote or let it autonomously navigate its environment.
## Features
**Manual Mode:** In this mode, you have full control over the Robot Car's movements. Use the remote control to steer the car in any direction, making it suitable for precise navigation and interactive play.

**Auto Mode:** Switch to auto mode to let the Robot Car explore its surroundings autonomously. It uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and make decisions to avoid collisions.
